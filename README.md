# ChaosMandala

This script generates a colorful "Chaos mandala" image using Python's PIL library. It creates a new image with various shapes like petals, stars, spirals, and polygons, arranged in harmonious layers. The colors are randomly selected within a harmonious palette. The script allows the user to view the generated mandala and decide whether to save it or generate a new one.
